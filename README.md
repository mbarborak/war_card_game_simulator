# War Simulator

War is a card game. Split a deck among the players. Each player turns over a card. The higher card wins the cards. On a tie, another card is turned over until there is a winner. Keep doing this until one player has all the cards.

I was curious how long a game lasts on average and what the variance was like. I was also interested in how often ties occur. (I defined a tie as lasting more then 3600 * 8 turns.)
